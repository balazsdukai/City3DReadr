A spark of a Python package that reads <bldg:Building>s from a CityGML and generates Python objects from their geometry. I use it for my thesis so its tailored to my needs and *very* limited in its functionality.

Largely adapted from Filip Biljecki's [CityGML2OBJs](https://github.com/tudelft3d/CityGML2OBJs).

Requires:

+ Python3.x

+ [CGAL Python3 bindings](https://github.com/CGAL/cgal-swig-bindings)

+ lxml
